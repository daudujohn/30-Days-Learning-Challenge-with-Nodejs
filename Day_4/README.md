# Day 4 | Packages and Package Managers

---

Yesterday, we learnt about **modularity,** its importance and how to introduce **modularity** in our code base using **file modules.** We then solved a simple math problem by writing a modular computer program.

Today, we will be learning about **packages** and **package managers**. Briefly, **packages** are **modules written by other programmers** which are made **publicly available** to other programmers. **Package managers** help us **manage packages** in our projects by providing easy functionality to **add, remove** and **upgrade packages** in our code base. 

We then look at the **package.json** file, which acts as a **config or settings file** for our project.

**Tip**: You should create a **folder structure** on your PC to organize all coding tasks for each day during the **30-Days Learning Challenge** with **Nodejs**

# Tasks

**Aim**

We are going to be adding some packages and logging what they export to the console

- Start **Visual Studio Code** using today’s task folder as the **current working directory**
- Run `npm init` or `npm init -y` to create a **package.json** file in today’s task folder
- Add the following packages to today’s task folder: **axios** and **express** using ****`npm install axios express`
- Create a file in today’s task folder named **index.js** and import **axios** and **express** using your knowledge on modules from yesterday
- Log the imported values to the console
- Expected output

Using **ES modules (import)**
