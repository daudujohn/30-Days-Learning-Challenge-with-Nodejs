# Day 7 | Core Module: stream

---

In our task for **Day 6** of the **30 Days Learning Challenge with Nodejs**, we noticed a considerable spike in the memory usage of a Nodejs process after reading a large file at once into memory.

This is unacceptable as we are to **design our programs to use system resources efficiently**.

**Streams** can be used to overcome this by allowing us **work with large data in chunks** rather than as a whole. Think of using **streams** as **breaking the large data into chunks** then placing those chunks on a conveyor belt. 

Nodejs provides some **readymade streams** (already created) for us to use. Nodejs also allows us to create our own **streams** through the **stream core module** (although we will not be covering this today).

**Tip**: You should create a **folder structure** on your PC to organize all coding tasks for each day during the **30-Days Learning Challenge** with **Nodejs**

# Tasks

**Aim**

We will be revisiting our task for **Day 6** of the **30 Days Learning Challenge with Nodejs** to make improvements**.** We will use `fs.createReadStream()`, **a readymade stream**, in place of `fs.readFileSync()`. We will then examine the memory footprint of the Nodejs process for any improvements.

- Copy the contents of yesterday‚Äôs task folder into today‚Äôs task folder
- Log the memory usage of the Nodejs process **before creating the readable stream** using this message: `‚ÄúMemory usage before creating read stream for large file = ${process.memoryUsage().rss}‚Äù`
- Inside **index.js**, replace `fs.readFileSync()` with `fs.createReadStream()`
- Log the memory usage of the Nodejs process **after creating the readable stream** using this message: `‚ÄúMemory usage after creating read stream for large file = ${process.memoryUsage().rss}‚Äù`
- Run `node index.js`
- Compare the spike in the memory footprint of the Nodejs process between yesterday. What do you notice? Can you explain why you are getting these results? ü§îü§îü§î
- Expected output

Memory usage for `fs.createReadStream()`
