# Day 3 | File Modules

---

In the past two days, we’ve been laying the groundwork for our work by performing installations, revising JavaScript etc.

Today, we will be learning about **modularity** and **file modules**. We will then solve a **simple math problem** by writing a **modular computer program**.

# Learning

[Modularity and File Modules](https://www.notion.so/Modularity-and-File-Modules-5acbb319b6a243bfb23367674edfa38b)

**Tip**: You should create a **folder structure** on your PC to organize all coding tasks for each day during the **30-Days Learning Challenge** with **Nodejs**

**Fun Fact**: Prior to **ES6** (a popular version of the **JavaScript Language Specification**), there was no language specific way to create file modules in JavaScript. 

Smart programmers relied on functions to achieve modularity because

- **Functions are re-usable** and
- **Function bodies have their own scope**

# Tasks

**Aim**

We are going to be creating a function that accepts two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the squares of both numbers. We will use our knowledge of modules to organize the solution to the problem

- Start **Visual Studio Code** using today’s task folder as the **current working directory**
- Create two files in today’s task folder: **main.js** and **module.js**
- Within **module.js,** declare the functions as described below and export them:
- A function that accepts **one number as a parameter** and **returns the square of the number**
- A function that accepts **two numbers as parameters** and **returns the sum of both numbers**
- Within **main.js,** import or require the two functions exported by **module.js**
- Within **main.js,** declare a function as described below:
- A function that accepts two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the squares of both numbers. 
**Note**: You are to use the imported functions from **module.js** as building blocks for creating this function
- Test your function in **main.js** with **inputs 3 and 4.** The **expected output** is **25**
