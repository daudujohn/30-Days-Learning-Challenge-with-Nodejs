# Day 21 | Web Security: HTTP Security Headers

Still on web security, we will be exploring some common HTTP security headers that we can include in HTTP responses coming from our servers. 

These HTTP security headers get recognized by web browsers and **trigger some security measures when web browsers interact with resources or responses from our web server origin**.

Check out this YouTube playlist, that describes some common HTTP security headers and the security measures they trigger in web browsers:

**Note**: there are standard bodies that give **design specifications to creators of web browsers** which is why these HTTP security headers are able to make web browsers behave in certain ways. However, it is **not guaranteed that all clients will respond correctly to the HTTP security headers** because not all clients follow the previously mentioned design specifications i.e., **all clients arenâ€™t web broswers**.
